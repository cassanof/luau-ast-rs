# A Parser and AST for Luau and Lua5.1 written in Rust

This is a tree-sitter-based parser for Luau and Lua5.1 written in Rust.
The grammar used is a fork of [polychromatist/tree-sitter-luau](https://github.com/cassanof/tree-sitter-luau).

This crate aims to provide a **_complete_** and **_fast_** parser for Luau, while also providing
pretty-printing and AST traversal utilities.

### Current Status

- Parser [WIP]
- Pretty-Printing [NOT STARTED]
